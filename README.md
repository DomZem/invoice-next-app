<h1 align="center" id="title">Invoice Next App</h1>

<p id="description">
This project is an Invoice Management System built with Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, React Query, Jest, and Testing-Library. It features a user-friendly interface with dark theme support, account creation using email, secure authentication with JWT access tokens, and CRUD operations on invoices. The application allows users to read invoices with pagination, filter them by status (Draft, Pending, Paid), and displays toasts for every mutation operation. Additionally, the project is responsive on mobile devices</p>
